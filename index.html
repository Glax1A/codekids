<h2>What's the story behind our initiative?</h2>
<h3>Founder & President - Aarush Kute</h3>
</div>
<p>Our initiative is deeply rooted in my personal journey, ignited by a pivotal moment in 4th grade when I first encountered an Arduino Uno. The sheer thrill of creating something tangible with technology sparked a profound interest that would shape my future. As I delved deeper into Arduino projects, I found myself not only fascinated but driven to push the boundaries of what I could achieve.
<br><br><br>
    With each project came new challenges, and I discovered the power of programming to bring my ideas to life. I vividly remember the satisfaction of seeing my code pass all test cases on a particularly challenging problemâ€”an achievement that fueled my passion for programming. This dedication and practice led me to remarkable successes, earning numerous awards on a national level and even placing in the top 40 globally in prestigious coding contests.
<br><br><br>
    These experiences instilled in me a desire to share the wonders of technology with younger generations. I realized the transformative impact that early exposure to STEM fields can have, and I'm committed to providing opportunities for kids to develop a love for technology just as I did. Our initiative aims to inspire and empower the next generation of innovators, fostering a community where curiosity thrives and dreams take flight in the boundless world of technology.</p>
